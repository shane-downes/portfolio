# Portfolio

I'm building this site to share personal projects I'm working on.

It's still a work in progress, but you can check it out at [shanedownes.com](https://shanedownes.com) ðŸš§

### Current features:

- Sticky navbar with slide out menu 
- Dark / Light mode toggle (in slide out menu)
- Detects if a user has requested light or dark color themes in their OS to set default mode
- Saves manual toggle mode preference in localstorage so it persists on refresh

### Stack:

- [`create-t3-app`](https://create.t3.gg/)
- [`typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org)
- [`tailwind-css`](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [`headless-ui`](https://headlessui.com/)
